## About Me

I am currently a **2nd year Master's student** majoring in **Health Informatics** in a joint programme between *Karolinska Institutet (KI)* and *Stockholm University*. My research interests lie in **Foundation Models for Science** (especially Biology and Healthcare) and **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**.

Previously I have conducted research in affiliation with the [Centre for Perceptual and Interactive Intelligence (CPII)](https://cpii.hk/), the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/) at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), and I am currently affiliated with the [Marklund Lab](https://www.marklundlab.org/) at KI.
Through my research experiences, I had opportunity to closely collaborate with [Yu Li](https://liyu95.com/) (CSE Department, CUHK), [Yimin Fan](https://fanyimin-cuhk.github.io/), [Ulrika Marklund](https://ki.se/personer/ulrika-marklund) (MBB Department, KI), and [Ziwei Liu](https://ki.se/en/people/ziwei-liu). 

In 2024, I earned my Bachelor's degree in **Artificial Intelligence: Systems and Technologies** at the *CUHK*, where my final year project focused on *Single Cell Foundation Models*.
